🧠 Brain Tumor Image Classification App


A Streamlit-based web application for classifying brain tumors using MRI scans. It integrates four fine-tuned deep learning models and a weight-aware decision module to improve diagnostic accuracy. Each model is trained and evaluated independently, with contributions weighted by scaled validation accuracy during inference.

🔗 🧠 Pretrained Models Used

Each model was fine-tuned independently and contributes to the ensemble based on its scaled validation performance:

🔗 DenseNet-169

Densely connected CNN that mitigates vanishing gradients and encourages feature reuse; known for efficiency in deep networks.

🔗 VGG-19

Deep CNN with 19 layers, developed by Oxford's VGG group; known for simplicity and consistent architecture.

🔗 Xception

Depthwise separable convolutions based on Inception architecture; excels in capturing spatial hierarchies efficiently.

🔗 EfficientNetV2-B2

Optimized for speed and parameter efficiency; balances depth, width, and resolution.

•NOTE: Each of the model training notebook has also been uploaded.


🔗 ⚙️ Core Contributions

• Multi-model ensemble with fixed weight voting, where weights are proportional to validation accuracy.

• Robust handling of multi-class classification tie cases.

• Achieved 98.7% classification accuracy across three tumor types (glioma, meningioma, pituitary).

• Streamlit deployment for real-time image upload and prediction.
